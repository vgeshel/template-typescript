# Vision

## Purpose

This template provides a production-ready foundation for building type-safe TypeScript web applications with Next.js. It eliminates boilerplate setup time and enforces quality standards from day one through comprehensive ESLint rules, pre-commit hooks, and testing infrastructure.

## Users

Developers building full-stack TypeScript applications who value type safety, code quality, and rapid iteration. Both human developers and AI agents benefit from the strict guardrails and clear patterns.

## Problems Solved

- **Boilerplate fatigue**: Skip repetitive project setup and configuration
- **Type safety gaps**: Eliminate runtime type errors through end-to-end type safety from database to UI
- **Quality drift**: Enforce standards automatically via pre-commit hooks and ESLint rules
- **Integration complexity**: Pre-configured tRPC, React Query, and Next.js App Router work together seamlessly

## Long-term Direction

Evolve as a reference implementation for best practices in TypeScript full-stack development. Maintain strict quality standards while incorporating emerging patterns from the Next.js and TypeScript ecosystems. Support AI-assisted development through clear conventions and comprehensive test coverage.

## Core Principles

1. **Type safety everywhere**: No `any` types, no `as` casts, no runtime type surprises
2. **Quality by default**: Pre-commit hooks and linting prevent quality issues from entering the codebase
3. **Test coverage is mandatory**: 100% coverage threshold ensures all code paths are verified
4. **Explicit over implicit**: Clear imports, explicit types, and obvious data flow
5. **Convention over configuration**: Sensible defaults reduce decision fatigue
