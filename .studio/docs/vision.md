# Vision

## Purpose

This project provides a production-ready TypeScript + Next.js template that enforces type safety, test coverage, and code quality through automated tooling. It serves as a foundation for building type-safe web applications with integrated testing, validation, and API layer.

## Users

- **Frontend Developers** building React applications who want type-safe API communication
- **Full-Stack Developers** creating Next.js applications with server-side rendering
- **AI Coding Agents** (Claude Code) requiring structured guidance and strict validation
- **Teams** enforcing code quality standards through automated pre-commit hooks

## Problems Solved

- **Type Safety Violations**: Eliminates `any` types and unsafe casts through strict ESLint rules
- **Runtime Errors**: Catches type errors and validation failures before deployment
- **Test Coverage Gaps**: Enforces 100% test coverage with TDD workflows
- **Inconsistent Code Quality**: Automated formatting and linting with pre-commit hooks
- **API Type Mismatches**: End-to-end type safety from frontend to backend via tRPC

## Long-term Direction

Evolve into a comprehensive template ecosystem supporting multiple architectural patterns while maintaining zero-compromise type safety. Expand skills library for AI agents to handle complex workflows autonomously.

## Core Principles

1. **No Runtime Type Errors** — Strict TypeScript + Zod validation for external data
2. **Test-First Development** — All code changes require tests before implementation
3. **Automated Quality Gates** — Pre-commit hooks block substandard code from entering repository
4. **Type Safety Over Convenience** — Never sacrifice type safety for developer ergonomics
5. **AI-Assisted Development** — Provide structured guidance for autonomous agent coding
