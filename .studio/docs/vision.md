# Vision

## Purpose

This project serves as a production-ready TypeScript template for building type-safe Next.js applications with end-to-end type safety from database to UI. It provides a battle-tested foundation that enforces quality through automated tooling and comprehensive testing.

## Users

- **Development teams** building new TypeScript web applications
- **AI agents** (Claude Code) requiring a structured, well-documented codebase for autonomous development
- **Individual developers** seeking a starting point with best practices already configured

## Problems Solved

- **Type safety fragmentation** — Eliminates the gap between backend and frontend types through tRPC
- **Configuration fatigue** — Removes the burden of setting up ESLint, Prettier, testing, and pre-commit hooks from scratch
- **Quality regression** — Prevents common mistakes through strict TypeScript configuration and automated quality gates
- **Testing complexity** — Provides a working test setup with 100% coverage requirements

## Long-term Direction

Evolve into the definitive TypeScript template that teams reach for when starting production applications. Maintain focus on type safety, developer experience, and AI agent compatibility. Incorporate emerging patterns from the TypeScript ecosystem while maintaining stability.

## Core Principles

1. **Type safety above all** — No `any` types, no type assertions, validate external data with Zod
2. **Fail fast** — Pre-commit hooks block bad code before it reaches the repository
3. **Test comprehensively** — 100% coverage requirement ensures all code paths are verified
4. **Convention over configuration** — Opinionated defaults eliminate decision paralysis
5. **AI-first development** — Structure and documentation optimized for autonomous agent development
