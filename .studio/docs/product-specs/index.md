# Product Specifications Index

This template provides foundational infrastructure rather than end-user features. Product specifications should be added as teams build features on top of this foundation.

## Infrastructure Specifications

- **[Type Safety System](type-safety-system.md)** — End-to-end type safety enforcement through TypeScript strict mode, ESLint rules, and Zod validation
- **[Development Workflow](development-workflow.md)** — Pre-commit hooks, TDD requirements, and quality gates
- **[API Layer](api-layer.md)** — tRPC procedures, request/response validation, and error handling
- **[Testing Infrastructure](testing-infrastructure.md)** — Vitest configuration, coverage requirements, and test patterns
- **[Logging System](logging-system.md)** — Structured logging with Pino, log levels, and child logger creation

## Future Feature Areas

As teams build on this template, add specifications for:

- Authentication and authorization
- Database models and migrations
- User-facing features
- Admin interfaces
- API integrations
- Background jobs
