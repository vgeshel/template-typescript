# Agent Instructions (Codex + other agents)

Primary guidance for this repo lives in `CLAUDE.md`. Read it first.

Then load the rule files in `.claude/rules/` and any skill docs in `.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md` and treat them as project rules/skills.

Claude Code hooks live in `.claude/hooks`, but Codex does not use hooks, so they can be ignored.
